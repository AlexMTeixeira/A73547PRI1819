         </h5>
         <p align="center">Alif Lam Ra. These are the verses of the Book that makes (things) manifest.<br>Surely We have revealed it — an Arabic Quran — that you may understand.<br>We narrate to you the best of narratives, by Our revealing to you this Quran, though
            before this you were certainly one of those who did not know.<br>When Yusuf said to his father: O my father! surely I saw eleven stars and the sun
            and the moon — I saw them making obeisance to me.<br>He said: O my son! do not relate your vision to your brothers, lest they devise a
            plan against you; surely the Shaitan is an open enemy to man.<br>And thus will your Lord choose you and teach you the interpretation of sayings and
            make His favor complete to you and to the children of Yaqoub, as He made it complete
            before to your fathers, Ibrahim and Ishaq; surely your Lord is Knowing, Wise.<br>Certainly in Yusuf and his brothers there are signs for the inquirers.<br>When they said: Certainly Yusuf and his brother are dearer to our father than we,
            though we are a (stronger) company; most surely our father is in manifest error:<br>Slay Yusuf or cast him (forth) into some land, so that your father's regard may be
            exclusively for you, and after that you may be a righteous people.<br>A speaker from among them said: Do not slay Yusuf, and cast him down into the bottom
            of the pit if you must do (it), (so that) some of the travellers may pick him up.<br>They said: O our father! what reason have you that you do not trust in us with respect
            to Yusuf? And most surely we are his sincere well-wishers:<br>Send him with us tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and sport, and surely we will
            guard him well.<br>He said: Surely it grieves me that you should take him off, and I fear lest the wolf
            devour him while you are heedless of him.<br>They said: Surely if the wolf should devour him notwithstanding that we are a (strong)
            company, we should then certainly be losers.<br>So when they had gone off with him and agreed that they should put him down at the
            bottom of the pit, and We revealed to him: You will most certainly inform them of
            this their affair while they do not perceive.<br>And they came to their father at nightfall, weeping.<br>They said: O our father! surely we went off racing and left Yusuf by our goods, so
            the wolf devoured him, and you will not believe us though we are truthful.<br>And they brought his shirt with false blood upon it. He said: Nay, your souls have
            made the matter light for you, but patience is good and Allah is He Whose help is
            sought for against what you describe.<br>And there came travellers and they sent their water-drawer and he let down his bucket.
            He said: O good news! this is a youth; and they concealed him as an article of merchandise,
            and Allah knew what they did.<br>And they sold him for a small price, a few pieces of silver, and they showed no desire
            for him.<br>And the Egyptian who bought him said to his wife: Give him an honorable abode, maybe
            he will be useful to us, or we may adopt him as a son. And thus did We establish Yusuf
            in the land and that We might teach him the interpretation of sayings; and Allah is
            the master of His affair, but most people do not know.<br>And when he had attained his maturity, We gave him wisdom and knowledge: and thus
            do We reward those who do good.<br>And she in whose house he was sought to make himself yield (to her), and she made
            fast the doors and said: Come forward. He said: I seek Allah's refuge, surely my Lord
            made good my abode: Surely the unjust do not prosper.<br>And certainly she made for him, and he would have made for her, were it not that he
            had seen the manifest evidence of his Lord; thus (it was) that We might turn away
            from him evil and indecency, surely he was one of Our sincere servants.<br>And they both hastened to the door, and she rent his shirt from behind and they met
            her husband at the door. She said: What is the punishment of him who intends evil
            to your wife except imprisonment or a painful chastisement?<br>He said: She sought to make me yield (to her); and a witness of her own family bore
            witness: If his shirt is rent from front, she speaks the truth and he is one of the
            liars:<br>And if his shirt is rent from behind, she tells a lie and he is one of the truthful.<br>So when he saw his shirt rent from behind, he said: Surely it is a guile of you women;
            surely your guile is great:<br>O Yusuf! turn aside from this; and (O my wife)! ask forgiveness for your fault, surely
            you are one of the wrong-doers.<br>And women in the city said: The chiefs wife seeks her slave to yield himself (to her),
            surely he has affected her deeply with (his) love; most surely we see her in manifest
            error.<br>So when she heard of their sly talk she sent for them and prepared for them a repast,
            and gave each of them a knife, and said (to Yusuf): Come forth to them. So when they
            saw him, they deemed him great, and cut their hands (in amazement), and said: Remote
            is Allah (from imperfection); this is not a mortal; this is but a noble angel.<br>She said: This is he with respect to whom you blamed me, and certainly I sought his
            yielding himself (to me), but he abstained, and if he does not do what I bid him,
            he shall certainly be imprisoned, and he shall certainly be of those who are in a
            state of ignominy.<br>He said: My Lord! the prison house is dearer to me than that to which they invite
            me; and if Thou turn not away their device from me, I will yearn towards them and
            become (one) of the ignorant.<br>Thereupon his Lord accepted his prayer and turned away their guile from him; surely
            He is the Hearing, the Knowing.<br>Then it occurred to them after they had seen the signs that they should imprison him
            till a time.<br>And two youths entered the prison with him. One of them said: I saw myself pressing
            wine. And the other said: I saw myself carrying bread on my head, of which birds ate.
            Inform us of its interpretation; surely we see you to be of the doers of good.<br>He said: There shall not come to you the food with which you are fed, but I will inform
            you both of its interpretation before it comes to you; this is of what my Lord has
            taught me; surely I have forsaken the religion of a people who do not believe in Allah,
            and they are deniers of the hereafter:<br>And I follow the religion of my fathers, Ibrahim and Ishaq and Yaqoub; it beseems
            us not that we should associate aught with Allah; this is by Allah's grace upon us
            and on mankind, but most people do not give thanks:<br>O my two mates of the prison! are sundry lords better or Allah the One, the Supreme?<br>You do not serve besides Him but names which you have named, you and your fathers;
            Allah has not sent down any authority for them; judgment is only Allah's; He has commanded
            that you shall not serve aught but Him; this is the right religion but most people
            do not know:<br>O my two mates of the prison! as for one of you, he shall give his lord to drink wine;
            and as for the other, he shall be crucified, so that the birds shall eat from his
            head, the matter is decreed concerning which you inquired.<br>And he said to him whom he knew would be delivered of the two: Remember me with your
            lord; but the Shaitan caused him to forget mentioning (it) to his lord, so he remained
            in the prison a few years.<br>And the king said: Surely I see seven fat kine which seven lean ones devoured; and
            seven green ears and (seven) others dry: O chiefs! explain to me my dream, if you
            can interpret the dream.<br>They said: Confused dreams, and we do not know the interpretation of dreams.<br>And of the two (prisoners) he who had found deliverance and remembered after a long
            time said: I will inform you of its interpretation, so let me go:<br>Yusuf! O truthful one! explain to us seven fat kine which seven lean ones devoured,
            and seven green ears and (seven) others dry, that I may go back to the people so that
            they may know.<br>He said: You shall sow for seven years continuously, then what you reap leave it in
            its ear except a little of which you eat.<br>Then there shall come after that seven years of hardship which shall eat away all
            that you have beforehand laid up in store for them, except a little of what you shall
            have preserved:<br>Then there will come after that a year in which people shall have rain and in which
            they shall press (grapes).<br>And the king said: Bring him to me. So when the messenger came to him, he said: Go
            back to your lord and ask him, what is the case of the women who cut their hands;
            surely my Lord knows their guile.<br>He said: How was your affair when you sought Yusuf to yield himself (to you)? They
            said: Remote is Allah (from imperfection), we knew of no evil on his part. The chief's
            wife said: Now has the truth become established: I sought him to yield himself (to
            me), and he is most surely of the truthful ones.<br>This is that he might know that I have not been unfaithful to him in secret and that
            Allah does not guide the device of the unfaithful.<br>And I do not declare myself free, most surely (man's) self is wont to command (him
            to do) evil, except such as my Lord has had mercy on, surely my Lord is Forgiving,
            Merciful.<br>And the king said: Bring him to me, I will choose him for myself. So when he had spoken
            with him, he said: Surely you are in our presence today an honorable, a faithful one.<br>He said: Place me (in authority) over the treasures of the land, surely I am a good
            keeper, knowing well.<br>And thus did We give to Yusuf power in the land — he had mastery in it wherever he
            liked; We send down Our mercy on whom We please, and We do not waste the reward of
            those who do good.<br>And certainly the reward of the hereafter is much better for those who believe and
            guard (against evil).<br>And Yusuf's brothers came and went in to him, and he knew them, while they did not
            recognize him.<br>And when he furnished them with their provision, he said: Bring to me a brother of
            yours from your father; do you not see that I give full measure and that I am the
            best of hosts?<br>But if you do not bring him to me, you shall have no measure (of corn) from me, nor
            shall you come near me.<br>They said: We will strive to make his father yield in respect of him, and we are sure
            to do (it).<br>And he said to his servants: Put their money into their bags that they may recognize
            it when they go back to their family, so that they may come back.<br>So when they returned to their father, they said: O our father, the measure is withheld
            from us, therefore send with us our brother, (so that) we may get the measure, and
            we will most surely guard him.<br>He said: I cannot trust in you with respect to him, except as I trusted in you with
            respect to his brother before; but Allah is the best Keeper, and He is the most Merciful
            of the merciful ones.<br>And when they opened their goods, they found their money returned to them. They said:
            O our father! what (more) can we desire? This is our property returned to us, and
            we will bring corn for our family and guard our brother, and will have in addition
            the measure of a camel (load); this is an easy measure.<br>He said: I will by no means send him with you until you give me a firm covenant in
            Allah's name that you will most certainly bring him back to me, unless you are completely
            surrounded. And when they gave him their covenant, he said: Allah is the One in Whom
            trust is placed as regards what we say.<br>And he said: O my sons! do not (all) enter by one gate and enter by different gates
            and I cannot avail you aught against Allah; judgment is only Allah's; on Him do I
            rely, and on Him let those who are reliant rely.<br>And when they had entered as their father had bidden them, it did not avail them aught
            against Allah, but (it was only) a desire in the soul of Yaqoub which he satisfied;
            and surely he was possessed of knowledge because We had given him knowledge, but most
            people do not know.<br>And when they went in to Yusuf. he lodged his brother with himself, saying: I am your
            brother, therefore grieve not at what they do.<br>So when he furnished them with their provisions, (someone) placed the drinking cup
            in his brother's bag. Then a crier cried out: O caravan! you are most surely thieves.<br>They said while they were facing them: What is it that you miss?<br>They said: We miss the king's drinking cup, and he who shall bring it shall have a
            camel-load and I am responsible for it.<br>They said: By Allah! you know for certain that we have not come to make mischief in
            the land, and we are not thieves.<br>They said: But what shall be the requital of this, if you are liars?<br>They said: The requital of this is that the person in whose bag it is found shall
            himself be (held for) the satisfaction thereof; thus do we punish the wrongdoers.<br>So he began with their sacks before the sack of his brother, then he brought it out
            from his brother's sack. Thus did We plan for the sake of Yusuf; it was not (lawful)
            that he should take his brother under the king's law unless Allah pleased; We raise
            the degrees of whomsoever We please, and above every one possessed of knowledge is
            the All-knowing one.<br>They said: If he steal, a brother of his did indeed steal before; but Yusuf kept it
            secret in his heart and did not disclose it to them. He said: You are in an evil condition
            and Allah knows best what you state.<br>They said: O chief! he has a father, a very old man, therefore retain one of us in
            his stead; surely we see you to be of the doers of good.<br>He said: Allah protect us that we should seize other than him with whom we found our
            property, for then most surely we would be unjust.<br>Then when they despaired of him, they retired, conferring privately together. The
            eldest of them said: Do you not know that your father took from you a covenant in
            Allah's name, and how you fell short of your duty with respect to Yusuf before? Therefore
            I will by no means depart from this land until my father permits me or Allah decides
            for me, and He is the best of the judges:<br>Go back to your father and say: O our father! surely your son committed theft, and
            we do not bear witness except to what we have known, and we could not keep watch over
            the unseen:<br>And inquire in the town in which we were and the caravan with which we proceeded,
            and most surely we are truthful.<br>He (Yaqoub) said: Nay, your souls have made a matter light for you, so patience is
            good; maybe Allah will bring them all together to me; surely He is the Knowing, the
            Wise.<br>And he turned away from them, and said: O my sorrow for Yusuf! and his eyes became
            white on account of the grief, and he was a repressor (of grief).<br>They said: By Allah! you will not cease to remember Yusuf until you are a prey to
            constant disease or (until) you are of those who perish.<br>He said: I only complain of my grief and sorrow to Allah, and I know from Allah what
            you do not know.<br>O my sons! Go and inquire respecting Yusuf and his brother, and despair not of Allah's
            mercy; surely none despairs of Allah's mercy except the unbelieving people.<br>So when they came in to him, they said: O chief! distress has afflicted us and our
            family and we have brought scanty money, so give us full measure and be charitable
            to us; surely Allah rewards the charitable.<br>He said: Do you know how you treated Yusuf and his brother when you were ignorant?<br>They said: Are you indeed Yusuf? He said: I am Yusuf and this is my brother; Allah
            has indeed been gracious to us; surely he who guards (against evil) and is patient
            (is rewarded) for surely Allah does not waste the reward of those who do good.<br>They said: By Allah! now has Allah certainly chosen you over us, and we were certainly
            sinners.<br>He said: (There shall be) no reproof against you this day; Allah may forgive you,
            and He is the most Merciful of the merciful.<br>Take this my shirt and cast it on my father's face, he will (again) be able to see,
            and come to me with all your families.<br>And when the caravan had departed, their father said: Most surely I perceive the greatness
            of Yusuf, unless you pronounce me to be weak in judgment.<br>They said: By Allah, you are most surely in your old error.<br>So when the bearer of good news came he cast it on his face, so forthwith he regained
            his sight. He said: Did I not say to you that I know from Allah what you do not know?<br>They said: O our father! ask forgiveness of our faults for us, surely we were sinners.<br>He said: I will ask for you forgiveness from my Lord; surely He is the Forgiving,
            the Merciful.<br>Then when they came in to Yusuf, he took his parents to lodge with him and said: Enter
            safe into Egypt, if Allah please.<br>And he raised his parents upon the throne and they fell down in prostration before
            him, and he said: O my father! this is the significance of my vision of old; my Lord
            has indeed made it to be true; and He was indeed kind to me when He brought me forth
            from the prison and brought you from the desert after the Shaitan had sown dissensions
            between me and my brothers, surely my Lord is benignant to whom He pleases; surely
            He is the Knowing, the Wise.<br>My Lord! Thou hast given me of the kingdom and taught me of the interpretation of
            sayings: Originator of the heavens and the earth! Thou art my guardian in this world
            and the hereafter; make me die a muslim and join me with the good.<br>This is of the announcements relating to the unseen (which) We reveal to you, and
            you were not with them when they resolved upon their affair, and they were devising
            plans.<br>And most men will not believe though you desire it eagerly.<br>And you do not ask them for a reward for this; it is nothing but a reminder for all
            mankind.<br>And how many a sign in the heavens and the earth which they pass by, yet they turn
            aside from it.<br>And most of them do not believe in Allah without associating others (with Him).<br>Do they then feel secure that there may come to them an extensive chastisement from
            Allah or (that) the hour may come to them suddenly while they do not perceive?<br>Say: This is my way: I call to Allah, I and those who follow me being certain, and
            glory be to Allah, and I am not one of the polytheists.<br>And We have not sent before you but men from (among) the people of the towns, to whom
            We sent revelations. Have they not then travelled in the land and seen what was the
            end of those before them? And certainly the abode of the hereafter is best for those
            who guard (against evil); do you not then understand?<br>Until when the apostles despaired and the people became sure that they were indeed
            told a lie, Our help came to them and whom We pleased was delivered; and Our punishment
            is not averted from the guilty people.<br>In their histories there is certainly a lesson for men of understanding. It is not
            a narrative which could be forged, but a verification of what is before it and a distinct
            explanation of all things and a guide and a mercy to a people who believe.<br></p>
