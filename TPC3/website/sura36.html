         </h5>
         <p align="center">Ya Seen.<br>I swear by the Quran full of wisdom;<br>Most surely you are one of the apostles,<br>On a right way.<br>A revelation of the Mighty, the Merciful.<br>That you may warn a people whose fathers were not warned, so they are heedless.<br>Certainly the word has proved true of most of them, so they do not believe.<br>Surely We have placed chains on their necks, and these reach up to their chins, so
            they have their heads raised aloft.<br>And We have made before them a barrier and a barrier behind them, then We have covered
            them over so that they do not see.<br>And it is alike to them whether you warn them or warn them not: they do not believe.<br>You can only warn him who follows the reminder and fears the Beneficent God in secret;
            so announce to him forgiveness and an honorable reward.<br>Surely We give life to the dead, and We write down what they have sent before and
            their footprints, and We have recorded everything in a clear writing.<br>And set out to them an example of the people of the town, when the messengers came
            to it.<br>When We sent to them two, they rejected both of them, then We strengthened (them)
            with a third, so they said: Surely we are messengers to you.<br>They said: You are naught but mortals like ourselves, nor has the Beneficent God revealed
            anything; you only lie.<br>They said: Our Lord knows that we are most surely messengers to you.<br>And nothing devolves on us but a clear deliverance (of the message).<br>They said: Surely we augur evil from you; if you do not desist, we will certainly
            stone you, and there shall certainly afflict you a painful chastisement from us.<br>They said: Your evil fortune is with you; what! if you are reminded! Nay, you are
            an extravagant people.<br>And from the remote part of the city there came a man running, he said: O my people!
            follow the messengers;<br>Follow him who does not ask you for reward, and they are the followers of the right
            course;<br>And what reason have I that I should not serve Him Who brought me into existence?
            And to Him you shall be brought back;<br>What! shall I take besides Him gods whose intercession, If the Beneficent God should
            desire to afflict me with a harm, shall not avail me aught, nor shall they be able
            to deliver me?<br>In that case I shall most surely be in clear error:<br>Surely I believe in your Lord, therefore hear me.<br>It was said: Enter the garden. He said: O would that my people had known<br>Of that on account of which my Lord has forgiven me and made me of the honored ones!<br>And We did not send down upon his people after him any hosts from heaven, nor do We
            ever send down.<br>It was naught but a single cry, and lo! they were still.<br>Alas for the servants! there comes not to them an apostle but they mock at him.<br>Do they not consider how many of the generations have We destroyed before them, because
            they do not turn to them?<br>And all of them shall surely be brought before Us.<br>And a sign to them is the dead earth: We give life to it and bring forth from it grain
            so they eat of it.<br>And We make therein gardens of palms and grapevines and We make springs to flow forth
            in it,<br>That they may eat of the fruit thereof, and their hands did not make it; will they
            not then be grateful?<br>Glory be to Him Who created pairs of all things, of what the earth grows, and of their
            kind and of what they do not know.<br>And a sign to them is the night: We draw forth from it the day, then lo! they are
            in the dark;<br>And the sun runs on to a term appointed for it; that is the ordinance of the Mighty,
            the Knowing.<br>And (as for) the moon, We have ordained for it stages till it becomes again as an
            old dry palm branch.<br>Neither is it allowable to the sun that it should overtake the moon, nor can the night
            outstrip the day; and all float on in a sphere.<br>And a sign to them is that We bear their offspring in the laden ship.<br>And We have created for them the like of it, what they will ride on.<br>And if We please, We can drown them, then there shall be no succorer for them, nor
            shall they be rescued,<br>But (by) mercy from Us and for enjoyment till a time.<br>And when it is said to them: Guard against what is before you and what is behind you,
            that mercy may be had on you.<br>And there comes not to them a communication of the communications of their Lord but
            they turn aside from it.<br>And when it is said to them: Spend out of what Allah has given you, those who disbelieve
            say to those who believe: Shall we feed him whom, if Allah please, He could feed?
            You are in naught but clear error.<br>And they say: When will this threat come to pass, if you are truthful?<br>They wait not for aught but a single cry which will overtake them while they yet contend
            with one another.<br>So they shall not be able to make a bequest, nor shall they return to their families.<br>And the trumpet shall be blown, when lo! from their graves they shall hasten on to
            their Lord.<br>They shall say: O woe to us! who has raised us up from our sleeping-place? This is
            what the Beneficent God promised and the apostles told the truth.<br>There would be naught but a single cry, when lo! they shall all be brought before
            Us;<br>So this day no soul shall be dealt with unjustly in the least; and you shall not be
            rewarded aught but that which you did.<br>Surely the dwellers of the garden shall on that day be in an occupation quite happy.<br>They and their wives shall be in shades, reclining on raised couches.<br>They shall have fruits therein, and they shall have whatever they desire.<br>Peace: a word from a Merciful Lord.<br>And get aside today, O guilty ones!<br>Did I not charge you, O children of Adam! that you should not serve the Shaitan? Surely
            he is your open enemy,<br>And that you should serve Me; this is the right way.<br>And certainly he led astray numerous people from among you. What! could you not then
            understand?<br>This is the hell with which you were threatened.<br>Enter into it this day because you disbelieved.<br>On that day We will set a seal upon their mouths, and their hands shall speak to Us,
            and their feet shall bear witness of what they earned.<br>And if We please We would certainly put out their eyes, then they would run about
            groping for the way, but how should they see?<br>And if We please We would surely transform them in their place, then they would not
            be able to go on, nor will they return.<br>And whomsoever We cause to live long, We reduce (him) to an abject state in constitution;
            do they not then understand?<br>And We have not taught him poetry, nor is it meet for him; it is nothing but a reminder
            and a plain Quran,<br>That it may warn him who would have life, and (that) the word may prove true against
            the unbelievers.<br>Do they not see that We have created cattle for them, out of what Our hands have wrought,
            so they are their masters?<br>And We have subjected them to them, so some of them they have to ride upon, and some
            of them they eat.<br>And therein they have advantages and drinks; will they not then be grateful?<br>And they have taken gods besides Allah that they may be helped.<br>(But) they shall not be able to assist them, and they shall be a host brought up before
            them.<br>Therefore let not their speech grieve you; surely We know what they do in secret and
            what they do openly.<br>Does not man see that We have created him from the small seed? Then lo! he is an open
            disputant.<br>And he strikes out a likeness for Us and forgets his own creation. Says he: Who will
            give life to the bones when they are rotten?<br>Say: He will give life to them Who brought them into existence at first, and He is
            Cognizant of all creation,<br>He Who has made for you the fire (to burn) from the green tree, so that with it you
            kindle (fire).<br>Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like of them? Yea!
            and He is the Creator (of all), the Knower.<br>His command, when He intends anything, is only to say to it: Be, so it is.<br>Therefore glory be to Him in Whose hand is the kingdom of all things, and to Him you
            shall be brought back.<br></p>
