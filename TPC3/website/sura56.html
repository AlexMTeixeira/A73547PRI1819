            you know not.<br>And certainly you know the first growth, why do you not then mind?<br>Have you considered what you sow?<br>Is it you that cause it to grow, or are We the causers of growth?<br>If We pleased, We should have certainly made it broken down into pieces, then would
            you begin to lament:<br>Surely we are burdened with debt:<br>Nay! we are deprived.<br>Have you considered the water which you drink?<br>Is it you that send it down from the clouds, or are We the senders?<br>If We pleased, We would have made it salty; why do you not then give thanks?<br>Have you considered the fire which you strike?<br>Is it you that produce the trees for it, or are We the producers?<br>We have made it a reminder and an advantage for the wayfarers of the desert.<br>Therefore glorify the name of your Lord, the Great.<br>But nay! I swear by the falling of stars;<br>And most surely it is a very great oath if you only knew;<br>Most surely it is an honored Quran,<br>In a book that is protected;<br>None shall touch it save the purified ones.<br>A revelation by the Lord of the worlds.<br>Do you then hold this announcement in contempt?<br>And to give (it) the lie you make your means of subsistence.<br>Why is it not then that when it (soul) comes up to the throat,<br>And you at that time look on — <br>And We are nearer to it than you, but you do not see — <br>Then why is it not — if you are not held under authority — <br>That you send it (not) back — if you are truthful?<br>Then if he is one of those drawn nigh (to Allah),<br>Then happiness and bounty and a garden of bliss.<br>And if he is one of those on the right hand,<br>Then peace to you from those on the right hand.<br>And if he is one of the rejecters, the erring ones,<br>He shall have an entertainment of boiling water,<br>And burning in hell.<br>Most surely this is a certain truth.<br>Therefore glorify the name of your Lord, the Great.<br></p>
