         </h5>
         <p align="center">Alif Lam Ra. These are the verses of the Book and (of) a Quran that makes (things)
            clear.<br>Often will those who disbelieve wish that they had been Muslims.<br>Leave them that they may eat and enjoy themselves and (that) hope may beguile them,
            for they will soon know.<br>And never did We destroy a town but it had a term made known.<br>No people can hasten on their doom nor can they postpone (it).<br>And they say: O you to whom the Reminder has been revealed! you are most surely insane:<br>Why do you not bring to us the angels if you are of the truthful ones?<br>We do not send the angels but with truth, and then they would not be respited.<br>Surely We have revealed the Reminder and We will most surely be its guardian.<br>And certainly We sent (apostles) before you among the nations of yore.<br>And there never came an apostle to them but they mocked him.<br>Thus do We make it to enter into the hearts of the guilty;<br>They do not believe in it, and indeed the example of the former people has already
            passed.<br>And even if We open to them a gateway of heaven, so that they ascend into it all the
            while,<br>They would certainly say: Only our eyes have been covered over, rather we are an enchanted
            people.<br>And certainly We have made strongholds in the heaven and We have made it fair seeming
            to the beholders.<br>And We guard it against every accursed Shaitan,<br>But he who steals a hearing, so there follows him a visible flame.<br>And the earth — We have spread it forth and made in it firm mountains and caused to
            grow in it of every suitable thing.<br>And We have made in it means of subsistence for you and for him for whom you are not
            the suppliers.<br>And there is not a thing but with Us are the treasures of it, and We do not send it
            down but in a known measure.<br>And We send the winds fertilizing, then send down water from the cloud so We give
            it to you to drink of, nor is it you who store it up.<br>And most surely We bring to life and cause to die and We are the heirs.<br>And certainly We know those of you who have gone before and We certainly know those
            who shall come later.<br>And surely your Lord will gather them together; surely He is Wise, Knowing.<br>And certainly We created man of clay that gives forth sound, of black mud fashioned
            in shape.<br>And the jinn We created before, of intensely hot fire.<br>And when your Lord said to the angels: Surely I am going to create a mortal of the
            essence of black mud fashioned in shape.<br>So when I have made him complete and breathed into him of My spirit, fall down making
            obeisance to him.<br>So the angels made obeisance, all of them together,<br>But Iblis (did it not); he refused to be with those who made obeisance.<br>He said: O Iblis! what excuse have you that you are not with those who make obeisance?<br>He said: I am not such that I should make obeisance to a mortal whom Thou hast created
            of the essence of black mud fashioned in shape.<br>He said: Then get out of it, for surely you are driven away:<br>And surely on you is curse until the day of judgment.<br>He said: My Lord! then respite me till the time when they are raised.<br>He said: So surely you are of the respited ones,<br>Till the period of the time made known.<br>He said: My Lord! because Thou hast made life evil to me, I will certainly make (evil)
            fair-seeming to them on earth, and I will certainly cause them all to deviate,<br>Except Thy servants from among them, the devoted ones.<br>He said: This is a right way with Me:<br>Surely, as regards My servants, you have no authority over them except those who follow
            you of the deviators.<br>And surely Hell is the promised place of them all:<br>It has seven gates; for every gate there shall be a separate party of them.<br>Surely those who guard (against evil) shall be in the midst of gardens and fountains:<br>Enter them in peace, secure.<br>And We will root out whatever of rancor is in their breasts — (they shall be) as brethren,
            on raised couches, face to face.<br>Toil shall not afflict them in it, nor shall they be ever ejected from it.<br>Inform My servants that I am the Forgiving, the Merciful,<br>And that My punishment — that is the painful punishment.<br>And inform them of the guests of Ibrahim:<br>When they entered upon him, they said, Peace. He said: Surely we are afraid of you.<br>They said: Be not afraid, surely we give you the good news of a boy, possessing knowledge.<br>He said: Do you give me good news (of a son) when old age has come upon me? — Of what
            then do you give me good news!<br>They said: We give you good news with truth, therefore be not of the despairing.<br>He said: And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord but the erring ones?<br>He said: What is your business then, O messengers?<br>They said: Surely we are sent towards a guilty people,<br>Except Lut's followers: We will most surely deliver them all,<br>Except his wife; We ordained that she shall surely be of those who remain behind.<br>So when the messengers came to Lut's followers,<br>He said: Surely you are an unknown people.<br>They said: Nay, we have come to you with that about which they disputed.<br>And we have come to you with the truth, and we are most surely truthful.<br>Therefore go forth with your followers in a part of the night and yourself follow
            their rear, and let not any one of you turn round, and go forth whither you are commanded.<br>And We revealed to him this decree, that the roots of these shall be cut off in the
            morning.<br>And the people of the town came rejoicing.<br>He said: Surely these are my guests, therefore do not disgrace me,<br>And guard against (the punishment of) Allah and do not put me to shame.<br>They said: Have we not forbidden you from (other) people?<br>He said: These are my daughters, if you will do (aught).<br>By your life! they were blindly wandering on in their intoxication.<br>So the rumbling overtook them (while) entering upon the time of sunrise;<br>Thus did We turn it upside down, and rained down upon them stones of what had been
            decreed.<br>Surely in this are signs for those who examine.<br>And surely it is on a road that still abides.<br>Most surely there is a sign in this for the believers.<br>And the dwellers of the thicket also were most surely unjust.<br>So We inflicted retribution on them, and they are both, indeed, on an open road (still)
            pursued.<br>And the dwellers of the Rock certainly rejected the messengers;<br>And We gave them Our communications, but they turned aside from them;<br>And they hewed houses in the mountains in security.<br>So the rumbling overtook them in the morning;<br>And what they earned did not avail them.<br>And We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them two but in
            truth; and the hour is most surely coming, so turn away with kindly forgiveness.<br>Surely your Lord is the Creator of all things, the Knowing.<br>And certainly We have given you seven of the oft-repeated (verses) and the grand Quran.<br>Do not strain your eyes after what We have given certain classes of them to enjoy,
            and do not grieve for them, and make yourself gentle to the believers.<br>And say: Surely I am the plain warner.<br>Like as We sent down on the dividers,<br>Those who made the Quran into shreds.<br>So, by your Lord, We would most certainly question them all,<br>As to what they did.<br>Therefore declare openly what you are bidden and turn aside from the polytheists.<br>Surely We will suffice you against the scoffers,<br>Those who set up another god with Allah; so they shall soon know.<br>And surely We know that your breast straitens at what they say;<br>Therefore celebrate the praise of your Lord, and be of those who make obeisance.<br>And serve your Lord until there comes to you that which is certain.<br></p>
