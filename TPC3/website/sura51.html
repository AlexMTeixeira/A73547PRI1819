         <p align="center">I swear by the wind that scatters far and wide,<br>Then those clouds bearing the load (of minute things in space).<br>Then those (ships) that glide easily,<br>Then those (angels who) distribute blessings by Our command;<br>What you are threatened with is most surely true,<br>And the judgment must most surely come about.<br>I swear by the heaven full of ways.<br>Most surely you are at variance with each other in what you say,<br>He is turned away from it who would be turned away.<br>Cursed be the liars,<br>Who are in a gulf (of ignorance) neglectful;<br>They ask: When is the day of judgment?<br>(It is) the day on which they shall be tried at the fire.<br>Taste your persecution! this is what you would hasten on.<br>Surely those who guard (against evil) shall be in gardens and fountains.<br>Taking what their Lord gives them; surely they were before that, the doers of good.<br>They used to sleep but little in the night.<br>And in the morning they asked forgiveness.<br>And in their property was a portion due to him who begs and to him who is denied (good).<br>And in the earth there are signs for those who are sure,<br>And in your own souls (too); will you not then see?<br>And in the heaven is your sustenance and what you are threatened with.<br>And by the Lord of the heavens and the earth! it is most surely the truth, just as
            you do speak.<br>Has there come to you information about the honored guests of Ibrahim?<br>When they entered upon him, they said: Peace. Peace, said he, a strange people.<br>Then he turned aside to his family secretly and brought a fat (roasted) calf,<br>So he brought it near them. He said: What! will you not eat?<br>So he conceived in his mind a fear on account of them. They said: Fear not. And they
            gave him the good news of a boy possessing knowledge.<br>Then his wife came up in great grief, and she struck her face and said: An old barren
            woman!<br>They said: Thus says your Lord: Surely He is the Wise, the Knowing.<br>He said: What is your affair then, O messengers!<br>They said: Surely we are sent to a guilty people,<br>That we may send down upon them stone of clay,<br>Sent forth from your Lord for the extravagant.<br>Then We brought forth such as were therein of the believers.<br>But We did not find therein save a (single) house of those who submitted (the Muslims).<br>And We left therein a sign for those who fear the painful punishment.<br>And in Musa: When We sent him to Firon with clear authority.<br>But he turned away with his forces and said: A magician or a mad man.<br>So We seized him and his hosts and hurled them into the sea and he was blamable.<br>And in Ad: When We sent upon them the destructive wind.<br>It did not leave aught on which it blew, but it made it like ashes.<br>And in Samood: When it was said to them: Enjoy yourselves for a while.<br>But they revolted against the commandment of their Lord, so the rumbling overtook
            them while they saw.<br>So they were not able to rise up, nor could they defend themselves;<br>And the people of Nuh before, surely they were a transgressing people.<br>And the heaven, We raised it high with power, and most surely We are the makers of
            things ample.<br>And the earth, We have made it a wide extent; how well have We then spread (it) out.<br>And of everything We have created pairs that you may be mindful.<br>Therefore fly to Allah, surely I am a plain warner to you from Him.<br>And do not set up with Allah another god: surely I am a plain warner to you from Him.<br>Thus there did not come to those before them an apostle but they said: A magician
            or a mad man.<br>Have they charged each other with this? Nay! they are an inordinate people.<br>Then turn your back upon them for you are not to blame;<br>And continue to remind, for surely the reminder profits the believers.<br>And I have not created the jinn and the men except that they should serve Me.<br>I do not desire from them any sustenance and I do not desire that they should feed
            Me.<br>Surely Allah is the Bestower of sustenance, the Lord of Power, the Strong.<br>So surely those who are unjust shall have a portion like the portion of their companions,
            therefore let them not ask Me to hasten on.<br>Therefore woe to those who disbelieve because of their day which they are threatened
            with.<br></p>
