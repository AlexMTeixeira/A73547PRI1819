         <p align="center">Ta Sin Mim.<br>These are the verses of the Book that makes (things) clear.<br>Perhaps you will kill yourself with grief because they do not believe.<br>If We please, We should send down upon them a sign from the heaven so that their necks
            should stoop to it.<br>And there does not come to them a new reminder from the Beneficent God but they turn
            aside from it.<br>So they have indeed rejected (the truth), therefore the news of that which they mock
            shall soon come to them.<br>Do they not see the earth, how many of every noble kind We have caused to grow in
            it?<br>Most surely there is a sign in that, but most of them will not believe.<br>And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.<br>And when your Lord called out to Musa, saying: Go to the unjust people,<br>The people of Firon: Will they not guard (against evil)?<br>He said: O my Lord! surely I fear that they will reject me;<br>And by breast straitens, and my tongue is not eloquent, therefore send Thou to Haroun
            (to help me);<br>And they have a crime against me, therefore I fear that they may slay me.<br>He said: By no means, so go you both with Our signs; surely We are with you, hearing;<br>Then come to Firon and say: Surely we are the messengers of the Lord of the worlds:<br>Then send with us the children of Israel.<br>(Firon) said: Did we not bring you up as a child among us, and you tarried among us
            for (many) years of your life?<br>And you did (that) deed of yours which you did, and you are one of the ungrateful.<br>He said: I did it then while I was of those unable to see the right course;<br>So I fled from you when I feared you, then my Lord granted me wisdom and made me of
            the apostles;<br>And is it a favor of which you remind me that you have enslaved the children of Israel?<br>Firon said: And what is the Lord of the worlds?<br>He said: The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, if you would
            be sure.<br>(Firon) said to those around him: Do you not hear?<br>He said: Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of old.<br>Said he: Most surely your Apostle who is sent to you is mad.<br>He said: The Lord of the east and the west and what is between them, if you understand.<br>Said he: If you will take a god besides me, I will most certainly make you one of
            the imprisoned.<br>He said: What! even if I bring to you something manifest?<br>Said he: Bring it then, if you are of the truthful ones.<br>So he cast down his rod, and lo! it was an obvious serpent,<br>And he drew forth his hand, and lo! it appeared white to the onlookers.<br>(Firon) said to the chiefs around him: Most surely this is a skillful magician,<br>Who desires to turn you out of your land with his magic; what is it then that you
            advise?<br>They said: Give him and his brother respite and send heralds into the cities;<br>That they should bring to you every skillful magician.<br>So the magicians were gathered together at the appointed time on the fixed day,<br>And it was said to the people: Will you gather together?<br>Haply we may follow the magicians, if they are the vanquishers.<br>And when the magicians came, they said to Firon: Shall we get a reward if we are the
            vanquishers?<br>He said: Yes, and surely you will then be of those who are made near.<br>Musa said to them: Cast what you are going to cast.<br>So they cast down their cords and their rods and said: By Firon's power, we shall
            most surely be victorious.<br>Then Musa cast down his staff and lo! it swallowed up the lies they told.<br>And the magicians were thrown down prostrate;<br>They said: We believe in the Lord of the worlds:<br>The Lord of Musa and Haroun.<br>Said he: You believe in him before I give you permission; most surely he is the chief
            of you who taught you the magic, so you shall know: certainly I will cut off your
            hands and your feet on opposite sides, and certainly I will crucify you all.<br>They said: No harm; surely to our Lord we go back;<br>Surely we hope that our Lord will forgive us our wrongs because we are the first of
            the believers.<br>And We revealed to Musa, saying: Go away with My servants travelling by night, surely
            you will be pursued.<br>So Firon sent heralds into the cities;<br>Most surely these are a small company;<br>And most surely they have enraged us;<br>And most surely we are a vigilant multitude.<br>So We turned them out of gardens and springs,<br>And treasures and goodly dwellings,<br>Even so. And We gave them as a heritage to the children of Israel.<br>Then they pursued them at sunrise.<br>So when the two hosts saw each other, the companions of Musa cried out: Most surely
            we are being overtaken.<br>He said: By no means; surely my Lord is with me: He will show me a way out.<br>Then We revealed to Musa: Strike the sea with your staff. So it had cloven asunder,
            and each part was like a huge mound.<br>And We brought near, there, the others.<br>And We saved Musa and those with him, all of them.<br>Then We drowned the others.<br>Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe.<br>And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.<br>And recite to them the story of Ibrahim.<br>When he said to his father and his people: What do you worship?<br>They said: We worship idols, so we shall be their votaries.<br>He said: Do they hear you when you call?<br>Or do they profit you or cause you harm?<br>They said: Nay, we found our fathers doing so.<br>He said: Have you then considered what you have been worshipping:<br>You and your ancient sires.<br>Surely they are enemies to me, but not (so) the Lord of the worlds;<br>Who created me, then He has shown me the way:<br>And He Who gives me to eat and gives me to drink:<br>And when I am sick, then He restores me to health;<br>And He Who will cause me to die, then give me life;<br>And Who, I hope, will forgive me my mistakes on the day of judgment.<br>My Lord: Grant me wisdom, and join me with the good;<br>And ordain for me a goodly mention among posterity;<br>And make me of the heirs of the garden of bliss;<br>And forgive my father, for surely he is of those who have gone astray;<br>And disgrace me not on the day when they are raised,<br>The day on which property will not avail, nor sons,<br>Except him who comes to Allah with a heart free (from evil).<br>And the garden shall be brought near for those who guard (against evil),<br>And the hell shall be made manifest to the erring ones,<br>And it shall be said to them: Where are those that you used to worship;<br>Besides Allah? Can they help you or yet help themselves?<br>So they shall be thrown down into it, they and the erring ones,<br>And the hosts of the Shaitan, all.<br>They shall say while they contend therein:<br>By Allah! we were certainly in manifest error,<br>When we made you equal to the Lord of the worlds;<br>And none but the guilty led us astray;<br>So we have no intercessors,<br>Nor a true friend;<br>But if we could but once return, we would be of the believers.<br>Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe.<br>And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.<br>The people of Nuh rejected the apostles.<br>When their brother Nuh said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)?<br>Surely I am a faithful apostle to you;<br>Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me;<br>And I do not ask you any reward for it; my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds:<br>So guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me.<br>They said: Shall we believe in you while the meanest follow you?<br>He said: And what knowledge have I of what they do?<br>Their account is only with my Lord, if you could perceive<br>And I am not going to drive away the believers;<br>I am naught but a plain warner.<br>They said: If you desist not, O Nuh, you shall most certainly be of those stoned to
            death.<br>He said: My Lord! Surely my people give me the lie!<br>Therefore judge Thou between me and them with a (just) judgment, and deliver me and
            those who are with me of the believers.<br>So We delivered him and those with him in the laden ark.<br>Then We drowned the rest afterwards<br>Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe.<br>And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.<br>Ad gave the lie to the apostles.<br>When their brother Hud said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)?<br>Surely I am a faithful apostle to you;<br>Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me:<br>And I do not ask you any reward for it; surely my reward is only with the Lord of
            the worlds;<br>Do you build on every height a monument? Vain is it that you do:<br>And you make strong fortresses that perhaps you may<br>And when you lay hands (on men) you lay hands (like) tyrants;<br>So guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me<br>And be careful of (your duty to) Him Who has given you abundance of what you know.<br>He has given you abundance of cattle and children,<br>And gardens and fountains;<br>Surely I fear for you the chastisement of a grievous day.<br>They said: It is the same to us whether you admonish or are not one of the admonishers;<br>This is naught but a custom of the ancients;<br>And we are not going to be punished.<br>So they gave him the lie, then We destroyed them. Most surely there is a sign in this,
            but most of them do not believe.<br>And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.<br>Samood gave the lie to the apostles.<br>When their brother Salih said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)?<br>Surely I am a faithful apostle to you;<br>Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me:<br>And I do not ask you any reward for it; my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds:<br>Will you be left secure in what is here;<br>In gardens and fountains,<br>And cornfields and palm-trees having fine spadices?<br>And you hew houses out of the mountains exultingly;<br>Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me;<br>And do not obey the bidding of the extravagant,<br>Who make mischief in the land and do not act aright.<br>They said: You are only of the deluded ones;<br>You are naught but a mortal like ourselves; so bring a sign if you are one of the
            truthful.<br>He said: This is a she-camel; she shall have her portion of water, and you have your
            portion of water on an appointed time;<br>And do not touch her with evil, lest the punishment of a grievous day should overtake
            you.<br>But they hamstrung her, then regretted;<br>So the punishment overtook them. Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of
            them do not believe.<br>And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.<br>The people of Lut gave the lie to the apostles.<br>When their brother Lut said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)?<br>Surely I am a faithful apostle to you;<br>Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me:<br>And I do not ask you any reward for it; my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds;<br>What! do you come to the males from among the creatures,<br>And leave what your Lord has created for you of your wives? Nay, you are a people
            exceeding limits.<br>They said: If you desist not, O Lut! you shall surely be of those who are expelled.<br>He said: Surely I am of those who utterly abhor your doing;<br>My Lord! deliver me and my followers from what they do.<br>So We delivered him and his followers all,<br>Except an old woman, among those who remained behind.<br>Then We utterly destroyed the others.<br>And We rained down upon them a rain, and evil was the rain on those warned.<br>Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe.<br>And most surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.<br>The dwellers of the thicket gave the lie to the apostles.<br>When Shu'aib said to them: Will you not guard (against evil)?<br>Surely I am a faithful apostle to you;<br>Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me:<br>And I do not ask you any reward for it, my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds;<br>Give a full measure and be not of those who diminish;<br>And weigh (things) with a right balance,<br>And do not wrong men of their things, and do not act corruptly in the earth, making
            mischief.<br>And guard against (the punishment of) Him who created you and the former nations.<br>They said: You are only of those deluded;<br>And you are naught but a mortal like ourselves, and we know you to be certainly of
            the liars.<br>Therefore cause a portion of the heaven to come down upon us, if you are one of the
            truthful.<br>He said: My Lord knows best what you do.<br>But they called him a liar, so the punishment of the day of covering overtook them;
            surely it was the punishment of a grievous day.<br>Most surely there is a sign in this, but most of them do not believe.<br>And most surely your Lord is Mighty, the Merciful.<br>And most surely this is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds.<br>The Faithful Spirit has descended with it,<br>Upon your heart that you may be of the warners,<br>In plain Arabic language.<br>And most surely the same is in the scriptures of the ancients.<br>Is it not a sign to them that the learned men of the Israelites know it?<br>And if we had revealed it to any of the foreigners,<br>So that he should have recited it to them, they would not have believed therein.<br>Thus have We caused it to enter into the hearts of the guilty.<br>They will not believe in it until they see the painful punishment.<br>And it shall come to them all of a sudden, while they shall not perceive;<br>Then they will say: Shall we be respited?<br>What! do they still seek to hasten on Our punishment?<br>Have you then considered if We let them enjoy themselves for years,<br>Then there comes to them that with which they are threatened,<br>That which they were made to enjoy shall not avail them?<br>And We did not destroy any town but it had (its) warners,<br>To remind, and We are never unjust.<br>And the Shaitans have not come down with it.<br>And it behooves them not, and they have not the power to do (it).<br>Most surely they are far removed from the hearing of it.<br>So call not upon another god with Allah, lest you be of those who are punished.<br>And warn your nearest relations,<br>And be kind to him who follows you of the believers.<br>But if they disobey you, then say: Surely I am clear of what you do.<br>And rely on the Mighty, the Merciful,<br>Who sees you when you stand up.<br>And your turning over and over among those who prostrate themselves before Allah.<br>Surely He is the Hearing, the Knowing.<br>Shall I inform you (of him) upon whom the Shaitans descend?<br>They descend upon every lying, sinful one,<br>They incline their ears, and most of them are liars.<br>And as to the poets, those who go astray follow them.<br>Do you not see that they wander about bewildered in every valley?<br>And that they say that which they do not do,<br>Except those who believe and do good and remember Allah much, and defend themselves
            after they are oppressed; and they who act unjustly shall know to what final place
            of turning they shall turn back.<br></p>
