         <p align="center">I swear by those who draw themselves out in ranks,<br>Then those who drive away with reproof,<br>Then those who recite, being mindful,<br>Most surely your God is One:<br>The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and Lord of the easts.<br>Surely We have adorned the nearest heaven with an adornment, the stars,<br>And (there is) a safeguard against every rebellious Shaitan.<br>They cannot listen to the exalted assembly and they are thrown at from every side,<br>Being driven off, and for them is a perpetual chastisement,<br>Except him who snatches off but once, then there follows him a brightly shining flame.<br>Then ask them whether they are stronger in creation or those (others) whom We have
            created. Surely We created them of firm clay.<br>Nay! you wonder while they mock,<br>And when they are reminded, they mind not,<br>And when they see a sign they incite one another to scoff,<br>And they say: This is nothing but clear magic:<br>What! when we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then certainly be
            raised,<br>Or our fathers of yore?<br>Say: Aye! and you shall be abject.<br>So it shall only be a single cry, when lo! they shall see.<br>And they shall say: O woe to us! this is the day of requital.<br>This is the day of the judgment which you called a lie.<br>Gather together those who were unjust and their associates, and what they used to
            worship<br>Besides Allah, then lead them to the way to hell.<br>And stop them, for they shall be questioned:<br>What is the matter with you that you do not help each other?<br>Nay! on that day they shall be submissive.<br>And some of them shall advance towards others, questioning each other.<br>They shall say: Surely you used to come to us from the right side.<br>They shall say: Nay, you (yourselves) were not believers;<br>And we had no authority over you, but you were an inordinate people;<br>So the sentence of our Lord has come to pass against us: (now) we shall surely taste;<br>So we led you astray, for we ourselves were erring.<br>So they shall on that day be sharers in the chastisement one with another.<br>Surely thus do We deal with the guilty.<br>Surely they used to behave proudly when it was said to them: There is no god but Allah;<br>And to say: What! shall we indeed give up our gods for the sake of a mad poet?<br>Nay: he has come with the truth and verified the apostles.<br>Most surely you will taste the painful punishment.<br>And you shall not be rewarded except (for) what you did.<br>Save the servants of Allah, the purified ones.<br>For them is a known sustenance,<br>Fruits, and they shall be highly honored,<br>In gardens of pleasure,<br>On thrones, facing each other.<br>A bowl shall be made to go round them from water running out of springs,<br>White, delicious to those who drink.<br>There shall be no trouble in it, nor shall they be exhausted therewith.<br>And with them shall be those who restrain the eyes, having beautiful eyes;<br>As if they were eggs carefully protected.<br>Then shall some of them advance to others, questioning each other.<br>A speaker from among them shall say: Surely I had a comrade of mine,<br>Who said: What! are you indeed of those who accept (the truth)?<br>What! when we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then be certainly
            brought to judgment?<br>He shall say: Will you look on?<br>Then he looked down and saw him in the midst of hell.<br>He shall say: By Allah! you had almost caused me to perish;<br>And had it not been for the favor of my Lord, I would certainly have been among those
            brought up.<br>Is it then that we are not going to die,<br>Except our previous death? And we shall not be chastised?<br>Most surely this is the mighty achievement.<br>For the like of this then let the workers work.<br>Is this better as an entertainment or the tree of Zaqqum?<br>Surely We have made it to be a trial to the unjust.<br>Surely it is a tree that-grows in the bottom of the hell;<br>Its produce is as it were the heads of the serpents.<br>Then most surely they shall eat of it and fill (their) bellies with it.<br>Then most surely they shall have after it to drink of a mixture prepared in boiling
            water.<br>Then most surely their return shall be to hell.<br>Surely they found their fathers going astray,<br>So in their footsteps they are being hastened on.<br>And certainly most of the ancients went astray before them,<br>And certainly We sent among them warners.<br>Then see how was the end of those warned,<br>Except the servants of Allah, the purified ones.<br>And Nuh did certainly call upon Us, and most excellent answerer of prayer are We.<br>And We delivered him and his followers from the mighty distress.<br>And We made his offspring the survivors.<br>And We perpetuated to him (praise) among the later generations.<br>Peace and salutation to Nuh among the nations.<br>Thus do We surely reward the doers of good.<br>Surely he was of Our believing servants.<br>Then We drowned the others.<br>And most surely Ibrahim followed his way.<br>When he came to his Lord with a free heart,<br>When he said to his father and his people: What is it that you worship?<br>A lie — gods besides Allah — do you desire?<br>What is then your idea about the Lord of the worlds?<br>Then he looked at the stars, looking up once,<br>Then he said: Surely I am sick (of your worshipping these).<br>So they went away from him, turning back.<br>Then he turned aside to their gods secretly and said: What! do you not eat?<br>What is the matter with you that you do not speak?<br>Then he turned against them secretly, smiting them with the right hand.<br>So they (people) advanced towards him, hastening.<br>Said he: What! do you worship what you hew out?<br>And Allah has created you and what you make.<br>They said: Build for him a furnace, then cast him into the burning fire.<br>And they desired a war against him, but We brought them low.<br>And he said: Surely I fly to my lord; He will guide me.<br>My Lord! grant me of the doers of good deeds.<br>So We gave him the good news of a boy, possessing forbearance.<br>And when he attained to working with him, he said: O my son! surely I have seen in
            a dream that I should sacrifice you; consider then what you see. He said: O my father!
            do what you are commanded; if Allah please, you will find me of the patient ones.<br>So when they both submitted and he threw him down upon his forehead,<br>And We called out to him saying: O Ibrahim!<br>You have indeed shown the truth of the vision; surely thus do We reward the doers
            of good:<br>Most surely this is a manifest trial.<br>And We ransomed him with a Feat sacrifice.<br>And We perpetuated (praise) to him among the later generations.<br>Peace be on Ibrahim.<br>Thus do We reward the doers of good.<br>Surely he was one of Our believing servants.<br>And We gave him the good news of Ishaq, a prophet among the good ones.<br>And We showered Our blessings on him and on Ishaq; and of their offspring are the
            doers of good, and (also) those who are clearly unjust to their own souls.<br>And certainly We conferred a favor on Musa and Haroun.<br>And We delivered them both and their people from the mighty distress.<br>And We helped them, so they were the vanquishers.<br>And We gave them both the Book that made (things) clear.<br>And We guided them both on the right way.<br>And We perpetuated (praise) to them among the later generations.<br>Peace be on Musa and Haroun.<br>Even thus do We reward the doers of good.<br>Surely they were both of Our believing servants.<br>And Ilyas was most surely of the apostles.<br>When he said to his people: Do you not guard (against evil)?<br>What! do you call upon Ba'l and forsake the best of the creators,<br>Allah, your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of yore?<br>But they called him a liar, therefore they shall most surely be brought up.<br>But not the servants of Allah, the purified ones.<br>And We perpetuated to him (praise) among the later generations.<br>Peace be on Ilyas.<br>Even thus do We reward the doers of good.<br>Surely he was one of Our believing servants.<br>And Lut was most surely of the apostles.<br>When We delivered him and his followers, all — <br>Except an old woman (who was) amongst those who tarried.<br>Then We destroyed the others.<br>And most surely you pass by them in the morning,<br>And at night; do you not then understand?<br>And Yunus was most surely of the apostles.<br>When he ran away to a ship completely laden,<br>So he shared (with them), but was of those who are cast off.<br>So the fish swallowed him while he did that for which he blamed himself.<br>But had it not been that he was of those who glorify (Us),<br>He would certainly have tarried in its belly to the day when they are raised.<br>Then We cast him on to the vacant surface of the earth while he was sick.<br>And We caused to grow up for him a gourdplant.<br>And We sent him to a hundred thousand, rather they exceeded.<br>And they believed, so We gave them provision till a time.<br>Then ask them whether your Lord has daughters and they have sons.<br>Or did We create the angels females while they were witnesses?<br>Now surely it is of their own lie that they say:<br>Allah has begotten; and most surely they are liars.<br>Has He chosen daughters in preference to sons?<br>What is the matter with you, how is it that you judge?<br>Will you not then mind?<br>Or have you a clear authority?<br>Then bring your book, if you are truthful.<br>And they assert a relationship between Him and the jinn; and certainly the jinn do
            know that they shall surely be brought up;<br>Glory be to Allah (for freedom) from what they describe;<br>But not so the servants of Allah, the purified ones.<br>So surely you and what you worship,<br>Not against Him can you cause (any) to fall into trial,<br>Save him who will go to hell.<br>And there is none of us but has an assigned place,<br>And most surely we are they who draw themselves out in ranks,<br>And we are most surely they who declare the glory (of Allah).<br>And surely they used to say:<br>Had we a reminder from those of yore,<br>We would certainly have been the servants of Allah — the purified ones.<br>But (now) they disbelieve in it, so they will come to know.<br>And certainly Our word has already gone forth in respect of Our servants, the apostles:<br>Most surely they shall be the assisted ones,<br>And most surely Our host alone shall be the victorious ones.<br>Therefore turn away from them till a time,<br>And (then) see them, so they too shall see.<br>What! would they then hasten on Our chastisement?<br>But when it shall descend in their court, evil shall then be the morning of the warned
            ones.<br>And turn away from them till a time,<br>And (then) see, for they too shall see.<br>Glory be to your Lord, the Lord of Honor, above what they describe.<br>And peace be on the apostles.<br>And all praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.<br></p>
