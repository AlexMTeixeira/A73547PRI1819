         </h5>
         <p align="center">Suad, I swear by the Quran, full of admonition.<br>Nay! those who disbelieve are in self-exaltation and opposition.<br>How many did We destroy before them of the generations,<br>And they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves, and the
            disbelievers say: This IS an enchanter, a liar.<br>What! makes he the gods a single God? A strange thing is this, to be sure!<br>And the chief persons of them break forth, saying: Go and steadily adhere to your
            gods; this is most surely a thing sought after.<br>We never heard of this in the former faith; this is nothing but a forgery:<br>Has the reminder been revealed to him from among us? Nay! they are in doubt as to
            My reminder. Nay! they have not yet tasted My chastisement!<br>Or is it that they have the treasures of the mercy of your Lord, the Mighty, the great
            Giver?<br>Or is it that theirs is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between
            them? Then let them ascend by any means.<br>A host of deserters of the allies shall be here put to flight.<br>The people of Nuh and Ad, and Firon, the lord of spikes, rejected (apostles) before
            them.<br>And Samood and the people of Lut and the dwellers of the thicket; these were the parties.<br>There was none of them but called the apostles liars, so just was My retribution.<br>Nor do these await aught but a single cry, there being no delay in it.<br>And they say: O our Lord! hasten on to us our portion before the day of reckoning.<br>Bear patiently what they say, and remember Our servant Dawood, the possessor of power;
            surely he was frequent in returning (to Allah).<br>Surely We made the mountains to sing the glory (of Allah) in unison with him at the
            evening and the sunrise,<br>And the birds gathered together; all joined in singing with him.<br>And We strengthened his kingdom and We gave him wisdom and a clear judgment.<br>And has there come to you the story of the litigants, when they made an entry into
            the private chamber by ascending over the walls?<br>When they entered in upon Dawood and he was frightened at them, they said: Fear not;
            two litigants, of whom one has acted wrongfully towards the other, therefore decide
            between us with justice, and do not act unjustly, and guide us to the right way.<br>Surely this is my brother; he has ninety-nine ewes and I have a single ewe; but he
            said: Make it over to me, and he has prevailed against me in discourse.<br>He said: Surely he has been unjust to you in demanding your ewe (to add) to his own
            ewes; and most surely most of the partners act wrongfully towards one another, save
            those who believe and do good, and very few are they; and Dawood was sure that We
            had tried him, so he sought the protection of his Lord and he fell down bowing and
            turned time after time (to Him).<br>Therefore We rectified for him this, and most surely he had a nearness to Us and an
            excellent resort.<br>O Dawood! surely We have made you a ruler in the land; so judge between men with justice
            and do not follow desire, lest it should lead you astray from the path of Allah; (as
            for) those who go astray from the path of Allah, they shall surely have a severe punishment
            because they forgot the day of reckoning.<br>And We did not create the heaven and the earth and what is between them in vain; that
            is the opinion of those who disbelieve then woe to those who disbelieve on account
            of the fire.<br>Shall We treat those who believe and do good like the mischief-makers in the earth?
            Or shall We make those who guard (against evil) like the wicked?<br>(It is) a Book We have revealed to you abounding in good that they may ponder over
            its verses, and that those endowed with understanding may be mindful.<br>And We gave to Dawood Sulaiman, most excellent the servant! Surely he was frequent
            in returning (to Allah).<br>When there were brought to him in the evening (horses) still when standing, swift
            when running — <br>Then he said: Surely I preferred the good things to the remembrance of my Lord — until
            the sun set and time for Asr prayer was over, (he said):<br>Bring them back to me; so he began to slash (their) legs and necks.<br>And certainly We tried Sulaiman, and We put on his throne a (mere) body, so he turned
            (to Allah).<br>He said: My Lord! do Thou forgive me and grant me a kingdom which is not fit for (being
            inherited by) anyone after me;<br>Then We made the wind subservient to him; it made his command to run gently wherever
            he desired,<br>And the shaitans, every builder and diver,<br>And others fettered in chains.<br>This is Our free gift, therefore give freely or withhold, without reckoning.<br>And most surely he had a nearness to Us and an excellent resort.<br>And remember Our servant Ayyub, when he called upon his Lord: The Shaitan has afflicted
            me with toil and torment.<br>Urge with your foot; here is a cool washing-place and a drink.<br>And We gave him his family and the like of them with them, as a mercy from Us, and
            as a reminder to those possessed of understanding.<br>And take in your hand a green branch and beat her with It and do not break your oath;
            surely We found him patient; most excellent the servant! Surely he was frequent in
            returning (to Allah).<br>And remember Our servants Ibrahim and Ishaq and Yaqoub, men of power and insight.<br>Surely We purified them by a pure quality, the keeping in mind of the (final) abode.<br>And most surely they were with Us, of the elect, the best.<br>And remember Ismail and Al-Yasha and Zulkifl; and they were all of the best.<br>This is a reminder; and most surely there is an excellent resort for those who guard
            (against evil),<br>The gardens of perpetuity, the doors are opened for them.<br>Reclining therein, calling therein for many fruits and drink.<br>And with them shall be those restraining their eyes, equals in age.<br>This is what you are promised for the day of reckoning.<br>Most surely this is Our sustenance; it shall never come to an end;<br>This (shall be so); and most surely there is an evil resort for the inordinate ones;<br>Hell; they shall enter it, so evil is the resting-place.<br>This (shall be so); so let them taste it, boiling and intensely cold (drink).<br>And other (punishment) of the same kind — of various sorts.<br>This is an army plunging in without consideration along with you; no welcome for them,
            surely they shall enter fire.<br>They shall say: Nay! you — no welcome to you: you did proffer it to us, so evil is
            the resting-place.<br>They shall say: Our Lord! whoever prepared it first for us, add Thou to him a double
            chastisement in the fire.<br>And they shall say: What is the matter with us that we do not see men whom we used
            to count among the vicious?<br>Was it that we (only) took them in scorn, or have our eyes (now) turned aside from
            them?<br>That most surely is the truth: the contending one with another of the inmates of the
            fire.<br>Say: I am only a warner, and there is no god but Allah, the One, the Subduer (of all):<br>The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, the Mighty, the most
            Forgiving.<br>Say: It is a message of importance,<br>(And) you are turning aside from it:<br>I had no knowledge of the exalted chiefs when they contended:<br>Naught is revealed to me save that I am a plain warner.<br>When your Lord said to the angels; Surely I am going to create a mortal from dust:<br>So when I have made him complete and breathed into him of My spirit, then fall down
            making obeisance to him.<br>And the angels did obeisance, all of them,<br>But not Iblis: he was proud and he was one of the unbelievers.<br>He said: O Iblis! what prevented you that you should do obeisance to him whom I created
            with My two hands? Are you proud or are you of the exalted ones?<br>He said: I am better than he; Thou hast created me of fire, and him Thou didst create
            of dust.<br>He said: Then get out of it, for surely you are driven away:<br>And surely My curse is on you to the day of judgment.<br>He said: My Lord! then respite me to the day that they are raised.<br>He said: Surely you are of the respited ones,<br>Till the period of the time made known.<br>He said: Then by Thy Might I will surely make them live an evil life, all,<br>Except Thy servants from among them, the purified ones.<br>He said: The truth then is and the truth do I speak:<br>That I will most certainly fill hell with you and with those among them who follow
            you, all.<br>Say: I do not ask you for any reward for it; nor am I of those who affect:<br>It is nothing but a reminder to the nations;<br>And most certainly you will come to know about it after a time.<br></p>
