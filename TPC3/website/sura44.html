            your fathers of yore.<br>Nay, they are in doubt, they sport.<br>Therefore keep waiting for the day when the heaven shall bring an evident smoke,<br>That shall overtake men; this is a painful punishment.<br>Our Lord! remove from us the punishment; surely we are believers.<br>How shall they be reminded, and there came to them an Apostle making clear (the truth),<br>Yet they turned their backs on him and said: One taught (by others), a madman.<br>Surely We will remove the punishment a little, (but) you will surely return (to evil).<br>On the day when We will seize (them) with the most violent seizing; surely We will
            inflict retribution.<br>And certainly We tried before them the people of Firon, and there came to them a noble
            apostle,<br>Saying: Deliver to me the servants of Allah, surely I am a faithful apostle to you,<br>And that do not exalt yourselves against Allah, surely I will bring to you a clear
            authority:<br>And surely I take refuge with my Lord and your Lord that you should stone me to death:<br>And if you do not believe in me, then leave me alone.<br>Then he called upon his Lord: These are a guilty people.<br>So go forth with My servants by night; surely you will be pursued:<br>And leave the sea intervening; surely they are a host that shall be drowned.<br>How many of the gardens and fountains have they left!<br>And cornfields and noble places!<br>And goodly things wherein they rejoiced;<br>Thus (it was), and We gave them as a heritage to another people.<br>So the heaven and the earth did not weep for them, nor were they respited.<br>And certainly We delivered the children of Israel from the abasing chastisement,<br>From Firon; surely he was haughty, (and) one of the extravagant.<br>And certainly We chose them, having knowledge, above the nations.<br>And We gave them of the communications wherein was clear blessing.<br>Most surely these do say:<br>There is naught but our first death and we shall not be raised again.<br>So bring our fathers (back), if you are truthful.<br>Are they better or the people of Tubba and those before them? We destroyed them, for
            surely they were guilty.<br>And We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them in sport.<br>We did not create them both but with the truth, but most of them do not know.<br>Surely the day of separation is their appointed term, of all of them;<br>The day on which a friend shall not avail (his) friend aught, nor shall they be helped,<br>Save those on whom Allah shall have mercy; surely He is the Mighty the Merciful.<br>Surely the tree of the Zaqqum,<br>Is the food of the sinful,<br>Like dregs of oil; it shall boil in (their) bellies,<br>Like the boiling of hot water.<br>Seize him, then drag him down into the middle of the hell;<br>Then pour above his head of the torment of the boiling water:<br>Taste; you forsooth are the mighty, the honorable:<br>Surely this is what you disputed about.<br>Surely those who guard (against evil) are in a secure place,<br>In gardens and springs;<br>They shall wear of fine and thick silk, (sitting) face to face;<br>Thus (shall it be), and We will wed them with Houris pure, beautiful ones.<br>They shall call therein for every fruit in security;<br>They shall not taste therein death except the first death, and He will save them from
            the punishment of the hell,<br>A grace from your Lord; this is the great achievement.<br>So have We made it easy in your tongue that they may be mindful.<br>Therefore wait; surely they are waiting.<br></p>
