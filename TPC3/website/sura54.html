         <p align="center">The hour drew nigh and the moon did rend asunder.<br>And if they see a miracle they turn aside and say: Transient magic.<br>And they call (it) a lie, and follow their low desires; and every affair has its appointed
            term.<br>And certainly some narratives have come to them wherein is prevention — <br>Consummate wisdom — but warnings do not avail;<br>So turn (your) back on them (for) the day when the inviter shall invite them to a
            hard task,<br>Their eyes cast down, going forth from their graves as if they were scattered locusts,<br>Hastening to the inviter. The unbelievers shall say: This is a hard day.<br>Before them the people of Nuh rejected, so they rejected Our servant and called (him)
            mad, and he was driven away.<br>Therefore he called upon his Lord: I am overcome, come Thou then to help.<br>So We opened the gates of the cloud with water pouring down,<br>And We made water to flow forth in the land in springs, so the water gathered together
            according to a measure already ordained.<br>And We bore him on that which was made of planks and nails,<br>Sailing, before Our eyes, a reward for him who was denied.<br>And certainly We left it as a sign, but is there anyone who will mind?<br>How (great) was then My punishment and My warning!<br>And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, but is there anyone who
            will mind?<br>Ad treated (the truth) as a lie, so how (great) was My punishment and My warning!<br>Surely We sent on them a tornado in a day of bitter ill-luck,<br>Tearing men away as if they were the trunks of palm-trees torn up.<br>How (great) was then My punishment and My warning!<br>And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, but is there anyone who
            will mind?<br>Samood rejected the warning.<br>So they said: What! a single mortal from among us! Shall we follow him? Most surely
            we shall in that case be in sure error and distress:<br>Has the reminder been made to light upon him from among us? Nay! he is an insolent
            liar!<br>Tomorrow shall they know who is the liar, the insolent one.<br>Surely We are going to send the she-camel as a trial for them; therefore watch them
            and have patience.<br>And inform them that the water is shared between them; every share of the water shall
            be regulated.<br>But they called their companion, so he took (the sword) and slew (her).<br>How (great) was then My punishment and My warning!<br>Surely We sent upon them a single cry, so they were like the dry fragments of trees
            which the maker of an enclosure collects.<br>And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, but is there anyone who
            will mind?<br>The people of Lut treated the warning. as a lie.<br>Surely We sent upon them a stonestorm, except Lut's followers; We saved them a little
            before daybreak,<br>A favor from Us; thus do We reward him who gives thanks.<br>And certainly he warned them of Our violent seizure, but they obstinately disputed
            the warning.<br>And certainly they endeavored to turn him from his guests, but We blinded their eyes;
            so taste My chastisement and My warning.<br>And certainly a lasting chastisement overtook them in the morning.<br>So taste My chastisement and My warning.<br>And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, but is there anyone who
            will mind?<br>And certainly the warning came to Firon's people.<br>They rejected all Our communications, so We overtook them after the manner of a Mighty,
            Powerful One.<br>Are the unbelievers of yours better than these, or is there an exemption for you in
            the scriptures?<br>Or do they say: We are a host allied together to help each other?<br>Soon shall the hosts be routed, and they shall turn (their) backs.<br>Nay, the hour is their promised time, and the hour shall be most grievous and bitter.<br>Surely the guilty are in error and distress.<br>On the day when they shall be dragged upon their faces into the fire; taste the touch
            of hell.<br>Surely We have created everything according to a measure.<br>And Our command is but one, as the twinkling of an eye.<br>And certainly We have already destroyed the likes of you, but is there anyone who
            will mind?<br>And everything they have done is in the writings.<br>And everything small and great is written down.<br>Surely those who guard (against evil) shall be in gardens and rivers,<br>In the seat of honor with a most Powerful King.<br></p>
