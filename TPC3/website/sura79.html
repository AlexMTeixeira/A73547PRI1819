He made it.<br>He raised high its height, then put it into a right good state.<br>And He made dark its night and brought out its light.<br>And the earth, He expanded it after that.<br>He brought forth from it its water and its pasturage.<br>And the mountains, He made them firm,<br>A provision for you and for your cattle.<br>But when the great predominating calamity comes;<br>The day on which man shall recollect what he strove after,<br>And the hell shall be made manifest to him who sees<br>Then as for him who is inordinate,<br>And prefers the life of this world,<br>Then surely the hell, that is the abode.<br>And as for him who fears to stand in the presence of his Lord and forbids the soul
            from low desires,<br>Then surely the garden â€” that is the abode.<br>They ask you about the hour, when it will come.<br>About what! You are one to remind of it.<br>To your Lord is the goal of it.<br>You are only a warner to him who would fear it.<br>On the day that they see it, it will be as though they had not tarried but the latter
            part of a day or the early part of it.<br></p>
